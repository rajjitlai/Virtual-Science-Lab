## v1.1.3 - Model Optimization

### Changed
- Switched from `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free` to `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free` model
- Updated all documentation to reflect the new model choice
- The new model offers better performance and availability for educational use cases

### Reason
- The previous model (`openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`) was reported to be in high demand
- The new model (`mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free`) is optimized for instruction following and educational applications
- Better balance between performance and availability

## v1.1.4 - Model Name Correction

### Fixed
- Corrected the model name from `mistralai/mistral-small-3.1-24b-instruct:free` to `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct-2506:free`
- Updated all references in the code and documentation to use the correct model name
- The corrected model name matches the actual available model on OpenRouter

### Reason
- The previous model name was incorrect and would cause API errors
- Using the correct model name should resolve the errors you were experiencing

## v1.1.5 - Rate Limiting and Conversation History Optimization

### Fixed
- Added rate limiting to prevent too many requests in a short period
- Limited conversation history to last 6 messages to prevent context overflow
- Added debugging logs to help identify issues
- Improved error handling for subsequent API calls

### Reason
- The AI service was working for the first call but failing on subsequent calls
- This was likely due to either rate limiting or context length issues
- These changes should resolve the issue and make the AI service more reliable

## v1.1.6 - Documentation Updates

### Updated
- Updated [README.md](file:///d:/Other/Code/virtual-science-lab/README.md) to include information about rate limiting and conversation history optimization
- Updated [AI_SERVICE_SETUP.md](file:///d:/Other/Code/virtual-science-lab/docs/AI_SERVICE_SETUP.md) to include details about API protection features
- Added information about the built-in protection mechanisms in the AI service

### Reason
- To provide better documentation for users about the implemented protection features
- To help users understand how the AI service handles rate limiting and conversation history

## v1.2.0 - Switch to Google Generative AI
